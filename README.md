# Java Project 3
This project about creating methods

##### TODO:
* After cloning this project don't forget to import **junit5.4**, how:
    * Navigate to **MethodsTest.java**, mouse over red lines and add **junit5.4** to classpath
* Even after you add junit you'll have red under **MethodsTest.java** and it is ok, 
because you did not implemented methods yet
* Navigate to **MethodsCode.java** and start solving tasks, there you have to create methods 
and make sure that method name is exactly same as it is asked in task description
* After creating method(in each task), test will run, but before that you'll not able to run any test
* After making all test green, it means all test passed successfully, push your code to your **github** repo
